This project done for a graduate project I. System will take a snapshot
from plant and will say name of the plant with at least 60% accuracy. I
train the system using deep learning architectures(Alexnet, GoogleNet and
CaffeNet) for about 1000 kinds of plants. The network trained with ~600k
pictures and interface developed with python django frameworks as an
interface to the project.
